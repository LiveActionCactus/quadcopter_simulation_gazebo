Goals (as of 06Oct)
	- [DONE] tune the iris controller
	- [DONE] comment the code for readability (this includes the README)
	- [DONE] implement rudimentary waypointing
	- [DONE] implement minimum snap trajectory following
	- [DONE] implement circling trajectory
	- [DONE] implement figure-8 trajectory
	- automate the data output of the iris (imagining a c++ real-time interface here)
	- implement a geometric non-linear controller
	- Create video processing pipeline with on-board camera in Gazebo model
	- create a refreshing "command window" so I can easily swap between modes and trajectories
